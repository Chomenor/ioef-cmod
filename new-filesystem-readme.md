This is an updated file handling system for the ioquake3 project. It rewrites most of files.c and related components, and also includes tweaks in other parts of the game to use the updated filesystem functions.

Here are the key features:
- Improved resource conflict negotiation. Broken textures and other glitches from conflicting pk3s are greatly reduced.
- Improved load times, especially with lots of pk3s installed. Close to clean install performance with thousands of pk3s installed!
- Searching for resources across all mods, even ones that aren't loaded. Maps can use textures from missionpack even when team arena mode isn't active.
- Some new settings to fine tune filesystem and config file behavior.
- New debugging commands for map and mod developers.
- Various tweaks and security improvements.
- Various code features to support future developments, such as loading resources from non-file sources.
- New filesystem code is under ifdef and can be switched on and off at compile, to make integration with new projects easier.

Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions, feedback, or bug reports!

# Compiling

Should be very similar to regular ioquake3.

- For make builds, run "make NEW_FILESYSTEM=1".
- If you are using one of the build scripts instead of calling make directly, add the line "NEW_FILESYSTEM=1" to "Makefile.local"
- For visual studio, set "NEW_FILESYSTEM" in the preprocessor definitions for both the main game and renderer dlls.

There are some changes to the renderer dlls in the new filesystem. If you mix a renderer dll and main application that have different filesystem versions, the game should still run, but this isn't recommended or well tested.

# ID Pak Precedence

In the original filesystem the ID paks, pak0.pk3 - pak8.pk3, are treated with the same alphabetical precedence as any other pak. This means any pak in baseq3 that happens to have a higher alphabetical rank, such as "qpak.pk3", will override the ID paks if there are any resource conflicts. This can lead to unwanted effects if any misplaced or incompatible pk3s are present in baseq3.

In the new filesystem the ID paks, or whichever core paks were defined by hash when the game was compiled, are given automatic precedence over other paks in baseq3. If you want to intentionally override the ID paks without explicitly loading a mod, you can create a directory named "basemod" alongside baseq3 and place your mod paks in it. This way they will take precedence over anything in baseq3, even the ID paks.

In general regular maps and skins will work fine in baseq3, but things that work by overriding existing game assets, such as crosshairs, will need to be moved to basemod to take effect.

# Mod Settings Option

Currently ioq3 stores a separate copy of the game settings for every mod. Whenever the mod changes, either by a user action or connection to a server, the settings are reset using the q3config.cfg from the new mod directory. This can lead to unexpected effects for users, such as graphics settings going haywire and changing resolutions when connecting to a server. This can be especially frustrating given that many mods are mostly server side and don't need any custom settings anyway.

The new filesystem introduces a cvar called "fs_mod_settings", with the following effects:
- fs_mod_settings 0: All settings are loaded and saved in the q3config.cfg in baseq3, regardless of the current mod. Every mod uses the same settings. This is closer to the original q3 behavior.
- fs_mod_settings 1: Existing ioquake3 behavior, with separately stored settings for each mod.

I favor fs_mod_settings 0 as the default value, because it's usually easier to manage a few settings that need to be changed between mods than to have every setting change between mods. Mods that require custom settings will be fine if they use deconflicted cvar names to store their settings. It appears most mods work under this setting without significant issues.

Special note: If you set fs_game on the command line, you will need to set fs_mod_settings on the command line as well, or it will operate with the default value the game was compiled with. This is because the filesystem doesn't know the fs_mod_settings value until it loads the config file, but given fs_game is set it doesn't know which config file to load without knowing fs_mod_settings.

# Download Directory Options

There are two new settings that can be used to control automatic downloads.

- fs_saveto_dlfolder: If enabled, this will cause incoming downloads to be saved in the "downloads" folder within the target mod directory. For example, "baseq3/somefile.pk3" will be rewritten to "baseq3/downloads/somefile.pk3". Files stored directly in the mod directory will always take precedence over files in the downloads folder, to reduce the chance of automatically downloaded files causing problems.

- fs_restrict_dlfolder: This blocks loading any qvm or config files from pk3s in the downloads folder. When combined with the setting above it should prevent servers from executing the most risky types of content. This is likely to break compatibility with some servers unless you manually move pk3s out of the downloads folder.

This is based on ideas from github.com/ioquake/ioq3/issues/130

# Source Directory Options

A new cvar is introduced called "fs_dirs", which can be set from the command line to adjust which source directories the game uses to load/save files. The default is "*homepath basepath steampath". This means that homepath is the write directory, indicated by the asterisk, and the other locations are used for reading. The specific paths are still controlled by the "fs_homepath", "fs_basepath", and "fs_steampath" cvars, respectively.

Notes:
- You can set an asterisk on multiple directories. The additional directories will be used as backup write directories if the first one fails a write test.
- The write directory selected will always be treated as the primary read directory.
- If no directory passes a write test, or no write directory was set at all, the game will run in read-only mode.

Examples:
- "fs_dirs" = "*basepath": Read and write to fs_basepath only.
- "fs_dirs" = "homepath basepath": Read-only mode with homepath taking precedence over basepath.

# Cache Mechanisms

The new filesystem uses a file called "fscache.dat" to store pk3 index data and reduce startup time. Cached data is matched to pk3s by filename, size, and timestamp, so it shouldn't cause problems when pk3s are modified. If you suspect the cache could be causing a problem, you can delete the cache file or disable it by setting "fs_index_cache" to 0 on the command line.

The new filesystem also uses a memory cache to keep previously accessed files in memory for faster access. This helps speed up load times between maps. The size of this buffer is controlled by the "fs_read_cache_megs" cvar. The default is currently 64 for the client and 4 for the dedicated server. This value can be set to 0 to disable the cache altogether.

# Shader Precedence

This section concerns map and mod developers who work with shaders, specifically regarding cases where the same shader is defined differently in different pk3 files.

To start with an example, suppose you have a shader called "textures/myshader", in the file "scripts/myshaders.shader", located in "pak0.pk3" of your mod. Now suppose you want to release an update "pak1.pk3" that replaces this shader with an updated version. The correct way is to duplicate the file "scripts/myshaders.shader" into pak1.pk3 and then update the shader within that file. Due to filesystem precedence this will override the version of the file from pak0.pk3 so it doesn't get loaded at all, ensuring only the shaders from the updated file will be used.

Now suppose you were to name the updated shader file "scripts/myshaders2.shader". Both the old and new shader files will get loaded, since they have different names, leading to behavior that can be confusing and inconsistent across different versions of Quake 3. In the original filesystem the shader precedence tends to be the opposite of the filesystem precedence, so the shader from pak0.pk3 will usually take precedence over the one from pak1.pk3. But in the new filesystem, shaders are taken from the higher precedence pk3, regardless of the .shader filename. This is a much more robust approach in general, but it means that in rare cases mods that actually depend on the old backwards precedence behavior could break. Mods doing shader replacements should apply the .shader override technique if they want consistent behavior on both the original and new filesystems.

# Debugging Cvars

There are some new cvars that can be set to 1 to enable debug prints.

- fs_debug_state: logs changes to the primary filesystem state such as the current mod dir and server pak list
- fs_debug_refresh: logs warnings that come up during file indexing phase; best set from the command line and combined with fs_index_cache 0
- fs_debug_fileio: logs file reading/writing activity
- fs_debug_lookup: logs file index lookup activity
- fs_debug_references: logs pk3 referencing activity (used for downloads and pure lists)
- fs_debug_filelist: logs directory listing calls

# Debugging Commands

The following commands can be used to get an idea of where resources will come from in the filesystem. They generate a list of resources sorted from highest to lowest precedence. The first resource is typically what will be used by the game.

- find_file <file name>: General purpose file lookup. Example: find_file maps/q3dm11.bsp
- find_shader <shader/image name>: Locates both shaders and images with this name. Example: find_shader textures/base_floor/techfloor
- find_sound <sound name>: Locate sound resources with this name. Example: find_sound sound/weapons/noammo
- find_vm <vm/dll name>: Locate vm or dll resources with this name. Example: find_vm cgame

Once you run one of the above commands, you can use the "compare" command to find why one element in the list was chosen over the other. For example, run "compare 1 2" to check why the top element was selected over the second element. The list from one previous find command is stored in memory for the purpose of supporting this command.

# Known Issues

- Little to no testing has been done on less common platforms and build environments, or on big endian systems. Fortunately most of the issues that could come up should be limited to a few places like fsc_os.c.

- Only the makefile and msvc12 project files are updated to use the new filesystem. Some of the other project files and build scripts aren't updated yet. I figure somebody with more experience with those components would be better suited to make the changes.

- The code conventions used for the filesystem are a bit different from the main ioq3 codebase in terms of stuff like function capitilization and brace placement.

- The server-side pure verification function SV_VerifyPaks_f is no longer supported, since it has no security value in modern conditions. All other pure server functionality is supported and cross-compatible with existing clients and servers.
