This is an updated file handling system for ioquake3 and other Quake 3 based games. It is a near complete rewrite of files.c and related components, designed to enhance the performance, stability, and security of the game while maintaining compatibility with virtually all existing servers and content.

Here are the key features:
- Improved resource precedence system which significantly reduces conflicts between pk3s
- Greatly improved load times, especially with lots of pk3s installed
- Ability to use missionpack maps and textures when team arena mode isn't active
- Ability to customize the download and pure lists when hosting servers
- Safer downloading options and other security improvements
- New debugging commands to trace file/shader origins
- Improved recovery from server download errors such as broken HTTP links
- Fixed server-side pure list overflow issues
- Semi-pure server support
- Various other fixes and improvements

Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions, feedback, or bug reports!

# Installation & Usage

If you are using Windows, you can download a binary from the Github release page and extract it to your Quake 3 directory. For other operating systems, you will need to compile a binary yourself; refer to the instructions below.

In most cases everything will work under this filesystem the same as you are familiar with from ioquake3. One exception is that there are certain types of mods which will need to be moved from baseq3 to a directory called "basemod". If you are using mods installed in baseq3 please refer to the "precedence system" section below.

# Compiling

Should be very similar to regular ioquake3.

- For make builds, run "make NEW_FILESYSTEM=1".
- If you are using one of the build scripts instead of calling make directly, add the line "NEW_FILESYSTEM=1" to "Makefile.local"
- For visual studio, set "NEW_FILESYSTEM" in the preprocessor definitions for both the main game and renderer dlls.

There are some changes to the renderer dlls in the new filesystem. If you mix a renderer dll and main application that have different filesystem versions, the game should still run, but this isn't recommended or well tested.

# Precedence System

This filesystem uses improved logic to resolve conflicts between pk3s (i.e. when multiple pk3s contain conflicting resources). It follows a logical pattern that is roughly (mod paks > core game paks > current map pak > other paks), whereas the original filesystem uses a more archaic system where the base precedence for image-like content is approximately (shaders > tga images > jpg images) regardless of the filename/directory of the pk3s.

In short what this means is that in the standard Q3 filesystem, as you add more paks (such as custom maps) manually or through ingame downloads, there is an increased risk of conflicts that cause broken textures, wrong textures, or other errors. This is because there are various means by which any pk3 can override any other pk3 and the more pk3s are installed, the higher the chance of conflicts. This filesystem is able to prioritize the current mod, core game paks, and current map over other pk3s so the game is stable like a clean install no matter how many pk3s are installed.

NOTE that certain types of content such as crosshairs, enhanced texture mods, and VMs that work by overriding the ID paks will not work out of baseq3 due to the new precedence policy. These mods are still supported in this filesystem, but they need to be manually enabled by placing their pk3s in a directory called "basemod" instead of baseq3. This system gives the user control over which pk3s are allowed to modify the game and makes the game much more stable overall.

For a more detailed overview of the precedence changes refer to this [precedence chart](new-filesystem-precedence.png).

# Mod Settings Option

Currently ioquake3 stores a separate copy of the game settings for every mod. Whenever the mod changes, either by a user action or connection to a server, the settings are reset using the q3config.cfg from the new mod directory. This can lead to unexpected effects for users, such as graphics settings going haywire and changing resolutions when connecting to a server. This can be especially frustrating given that many mods are mostly server side and don't need any custom settings anyway.

This project introduces a command line cvar called "fs_mod_settings", with the following effects:
- fs_mod_settings 0: All settings are loaded and saved in the q3config.cfg in baseq3, regardless of the current mod. Every mod uses the same settings. This is closer to the original q3 behavior.
- fs_mod_settings 1: Existing ioquake3 behavior, with separately stored settings for each mod.

I favor fs_mod_settings 0 as the default value, because it's usually easier to manage a few settings that need to be changed between mods than to have every setting change between mods. Mods that require custom settings will be fine if they use deconflicted cvar names to store their settings. It appears most mods work under this setting without significant issues.

If you are wondering why this feature is relevant to a filesystem project, it is due the design of ioquake3. The function FS_ConditionalRestart, which is part of the filesystem, is responsible for initiating a reload of the game and settings when the mod changes. The functionality of fs_mod_settings 0 is achieved by modifying the restart conditions in FS_ConditionalRestart as well as adjusting the settings file paths to exclude mods.

# Download Directory Options

There are two new settings that can be used to control automatic downloads.

- fs_saveto_dlfolder: If enabled, this will cause incoming downloads to be saved in the "downloads" folder within the target mod directory. For example, "baseq3/somefile.pk3" will be rewritten to "baseq3/downloads/somefile.pk3". Pk3s directly in the mod directory will take precedence over those in the downloads folder.

- fs_restrict_dlfolder: This setting blocks potentially less secure content from pk3s in the downloads folder. It has three modes:
    * setting 0: No restrictions.
	* setting 1: Qvm files that do not match a list of known trusted mod hashes, and all config files, will be blocked.
	* setting 2: All qvm files and config files will be blocked.

These settings can increase security, but may break compatibility with some servers unless you manually move files out of the downloads folder.

# Inactive Mod Support

This filesystem supports loading files from all mod directories, not just the current active mod. This can help smooth out discrepancies between server directory configurations and allow maps to work correctly even if they have dependencies that, for one reason or another, are located in the wrong mod directory.

The precedence system ensures that files located in the current mod and basegame directories always have first priority. Inactive mods are only accessed as a last resort if files cannot be found anywhere else.

There are two cvars used to control this feature:
- fs_read_inactive_mods: Applies to file reading operations used to load content like models, textures, and sounds. (default: 1)
- fs_list_inactive_mods: Applies to file listing queries used by the ingame map and model menus. (default: 1)

Both cvars support the following settings:
- 0: Disabled; all files from inactive mods blocked
- 1: Enabled only for ID paks (including missionpack) and files on the connected server's pure list
- 2: Enabled; all files from inactive mods allowed

# Semi-Pure Server Support

This feature allows clients to load external content (particularly player models) when playing on an otherwise pure server. It retains the stability and compatibility benefits of a pure server, because the pure pk3s are prioritized over other pk3s, but is less restrictive when it comes to allowing content that doesn't exist in any of the pure pk3s.

To enable this feature, set sv_pure to 2 on the server. This will only affects clients using the new filesystem. Clients using the original filesystem will function the same as if sv_pure is 1.

# Cache Mechanisms

This filesystem adds two types of caches to improve load times, an index cache and a memory cache.

The index cache stores pk3 index data in a file called fscache.dat to reduce the initial game startup time. Cached data is matched to pk3s by filename, size, and timestamp, so it shouldn't cause problems when pk3s are modified. If you suspect the cache could be causing a problem, you can delete the cache file or disable it by setting "fs_index_cache" to 0 on the command line.

The memory cache is used to keep previously accessed files in memory for faster access and reduce load times between levels. The size of this buffer is controlled by the "fs_read_cache_megs" cvar. The default is currently 64 for the client and 4 for the dedicated server. This value can be set to 0 to disable the cache altogether.

# Download / Pure List Configuration

Two new cvars, "fs_download_manifest" and "fs_pure_manifest", are added to allow customizing which pk3s are added to the download and pure lists when running a server. Both cvars use a space-seperated list of selector rules that can be either specific pk3 names or one of the following keywords:

- *mod_paks - Selects all paks from the current active mod.
- *base_paks - Selects all paks from com_basegame (baseq3).
- *inactivemod_paks - Selects all paks in inactive mod directories (not baseq3 or the current mod) that are enabled by the fs_read_inactive_mods setting on the server. Under the default fs_read_inactive_mods setting of 1 this will select only the missionpack paks pak0-pak3.
- *currentmap_pak - Selects the pak containing the bsp of the current running map.
- *cgame_pak - Selects the pak containing the preferred cgame.qvm file.
- *ui_pak - Selects the pak containing the preferred ui.qvm file.
- *referenced_paks - Selects paks accessed during the loading process on the server.

The default download manifest selects all the paks from the current mod directory, as well as the current cgame and ui paks, and the current map pak. The *referenced_paks rule is currently added for consistency with original filesystem behavior, but in virtually all cases is redundant to the other rules and can be dropped without issue.
```
set fs_download_manifest *mod_paks *cgame_pak *ui_pak *currentmap_pak *referenced_paks
```

Some server configurations have a lot of maps or optional mod files in the mod directory. This can lead to clients having too many files to download, since the default behavior is to place everything in the mod directory into the download list. To avoid this, you can specify only the core mod files that clients require instead of using the *mod_paks rule. For example, here is a reduced download manifest for the OSP mod.
```
set fs_download_manifest osp/zz-osp-pak3 osp/zz-osp-pak2 osp/zz-osp-pak1 osp/zz-osp-pak0 *currentmap_pak
```

The default pure manifest selects every pak normally available to the game.
```
set fs_pure_manifest *mod_paks *base_paks *inactivemod_paks
```

Pure servers with a large number of pk3s in baseq3 (300+) can run into problems with the pure list overflowing. To avoid such issues you can replace the *base_baks rule in the pure manifest with specific core paks. Note that any auxiliary paks in baseq3 required by maps or mods, as well as optional content like player models, will need be included manually as well.
```
set fs_pure_manifest *mod_paks baseq3/pak8 baseq3/pak7 baseq3/pak6 baseq3/pak5 baseq3/pak4 baseq3/pak3 baseq3/pak2 baseq3/pak1 baseq3/pak0 *currentmap_pak
```

## Advanced Features

It is possible to specify pk3s by hash, to support conditions where the file may not physically exist on the server or may exist under a different name. If the file does not physically exist it can't be used for UDP downloads, but it can be used for pure lists and download lists on HTTP-only servers (with sv_dlURL active and sv_allowDownload set to 0). To use this feature, specify paks using the format [mod]/[name]:[hash]. The hash can be specified in either signed or unsigned integer format.
```
set fs_pure_manifest *mod_paks *base_paks *inactivemod_paks baseq3/md3-bender:-722067772 baseq3/md3-laracroft:1134218139 baseq3/md3-spongebob:-871946717
```

The order of the pure list determines the precedence of files on clients. Normally the server sorts the pure list according to filesystem precedence conventions, rather than the order in the pure manifest, but there may be special conditions where it is useful to force a certain order in the pure list. This can be accomplished by separating sections in the pure manifest with a dash. In this example baseq3/somefile.pk3 will be the first entry on the pure list and have the highest precedence, regardless of where it stands in the normal filesystem ordering. Note that if the same pk3 is selected by multiple rules, its position will be determined by the first rule that selected it.
```
set fs_pure_manifest baseq3/somefile - *mod_paks *base_paks *currentmap_pak
```

In some cases it can be convenient to exclude a certain pk3 that would otherwise be selected by one or more rules within a manifest. This can be accomplished by using the "&exclude" command followed by a normal selector rule. All pk3s selected by the rule will be blocked, based on hash, from being selected by any subsequent rules. In this example, the "mod/somemap.pk3" file can be selected by the *currentmap_pak rule, but not subsequent rules such as *mod_paks because they come after the exclude command.
```
set fs_download_manifest *currentmap_pak &exclude mod/somemap *mod_paks *cgame_pak *ui_pak *referenced_paks
```

Paks from inactive mod directories can be added to the pure and download manifests, but clients will need to be using this filesystem or an engine with equivalent inactive mod support in order to use them. This can be used to support special configurations involving a hybrid of multiple mods. It is currently only supported to use inactive mod pk3s in the download manifest if you assume all clients have inactive mod support, because otherwise other clients will encounter errors attempting the download.

# Source Directory Options

A new cvar is introduced called "fs_dirs", which can be set from the command line to adjust which source directories the game uses to load/save files. The default is "*fs_homepath fs_basepath fs_steampath fs_gogpath". This means that homepath is the write directory, indicated by the asterisk, and the other locations are used for reading. The specific paths are still controlled by the "fs_homepath", "fs_basepath", "fs_steampath", and "fs_gogpath" cvars, respectively.

Notes:
- You can specify arbitrary cvars to use as source directories, instead of the default ones like fs_basepath and fs_homepath, but the specified cvars must be set on the command line along with fs_dirs in order to take effect.
- You can set an asterisk on multiple directories. The additional directories will be used as backup write directories if the first one fails a write test.
- The write directory selected will always be treated as the highest precedence read directory.
- If no directory passes a write test, or no write directory was set (no asterisks), the game will run in read-only mode.

Examples:
- +set fs_dirs fs_homepath fs_basepath: Read-only mode with homepath taking precedence over basepath in the event that both directories contain files with the same name.
- +set fs_dirs *fs_basepath *fs_homepath: Try to use fs_basepath as the write directory, but fall back to fs_homepath if basepath is not writable. Both basepath and homepath will be readable, with whichever directory is used as the write directory taking precedence.

## Auxiliary Source Directories

This is an advanced feature that allows source directories to be loaded, but with restricted effects on the game. It is primarily intended for server hosting configurations. An auxiliary source directory has the following properties:

- For file reading operations, auxiliary source directories are strictly prioritized below non-auxiliary directories, even if the auxiliary directory contains a higher precedence mod directory or pk3 filename.
- For file listing operations, auxiliary source directories are excluded entirely.
- Auxiliary source directories do not affect the default order for pure list generation. Pk3s in auxiliary source directories are prioritized normally alongside other pk3s for pure server purposes.

Auxiliary source directories can be useful in the following cases:

- To prevent map pk3s from adding bots or causing conflicts with the server configuration. This can be especially useful for servers with hundreds or thousands of map pk3s installed, which may not be well vetted to be free of conflicts.
- To include client mod pk3s needed for the pure or download list without allowing them to modify the configuration of the server itself.

To specify an auxiliary source directory, include a number sign (#) in front of the directory name in fs_dirs. Example:

+set fs_dirs *fs_basepath #fs_auxiliary +set fs_auxiliary /home/user/q3auxiliary

# Shader Precedence

In this filesystem, shader precedence follows the same rules as normal filesystem precedence, e.g. a shader in pak2.pk3 will override a shader in pak1.pk3, and a shader in a mod will override a shader in baseq3. However, the original filesystem uses the opposite precedence when shaders are defined in .shader files with different names, which can make things confusing for mod authors. Here are some tips for mod authors working with shader definitions:

- To update shaders in an existing pak from your mod to a new version, copy the .shader file from the earlier pak to the new pak, keeping the same filename. Then modify the shader(s) in the new file. The original filesystem will only load the newer file, so make sure it contains all the shaders from the original file as well.

- If you wish to override a shader from paks in baseq3, such as the ID paks, you need to copy the most recent version of every .shader file containing that shader into your mod, then modify the shader within those files. If you simply define the shader without following these steps, it will work on the new filesystem, but not the original filesystem.

- Conversely, make sure you don't accidentally define unwanted shaders that conflict with the ID paks or earlier paks from your mod in arbitrary .shader files. These will be overridden in the original filesystem but will take effect on the new filesystem, which could lead to problems.

# Debugging Cvars

This project introduces some new cvars that can be set to 1 to enable debug prints.

- fs_debug_state: logs changes to the primary filesystem state such as the current mod dir and server pure list
- fs_debug_refresh: logs warnings that come up during file indexing phase; best set from the command line and combined with fs_index_cache 0
- fs_debug_fileio: logs file reading/writing activity
- fs_debug_lookup: logs file index lookup activity
- fs_debug_references: logs pk3 referencing activity (used for downloads and pure lists)
- fs_debug_filelist: logs directory listing calls

# Debugging Commands

The following commands can be used to get an idea of where resources will come from in the filesystem. They generate a list of resources sorted from highest to lowest precedence. The first resource is typically what will be used by the game.

- find_file <file name>: General purpose file lookup. Example: find_file maps/q3dm11.bsp
- find_shader <shader/image name>: Locates both shaders and images with this name. Example: find_shader textures/base_floor/techfloor
- find_sound <sound name>: Locate sound resources with this name. Example: find_sound sound/weapons/noammo
- find_vm <vm/dll name>: Locate vm or dll resources with this name. Example: find_vm cgame

Once you run one of the above commands, you can use the "compare" command to find why one element in the list was chosen over the other. For example, run "compare 1 2" to check why the top element was selected over the second element. The list from one previous find command is stored in memory for the purpose of supporting this command.

# Known Issues

This project is fairly well developed at this point, so there are few significant known issues. If you find any new issues, feel free to email me or open an issue on GitHub.

- This is currently an engine only modification, and does not remove limits in the UI on the number of maps and models that can appear in the menus. The UI code will need to be changed in mods to raise these limits. You can still load maps and models through the console or by connecting to a server even if they don't appear in the menu.

- The code style (e.g. capitalization and brace placement) used in this project are different than typical ioquake3 conventions. This mostly applies to code under the filesystem directory; code integrated with existing source files follows the conventions in those files more closely.

- Limited testing has been done on less common platforms and build environments or on big endian systems. Testing help and feedback for such platforms is appreciated.

- Only the makefile and msvc12 project files are updated to use the new filesystem. Some of the other project files and build scripts aren't updated yet. It appears most of these files are in an unmaintained state in ioquake3 anyway.
