## ioquake3 Security
We take security very seriously at ioquake3. We welcome any peer review of our 100% free software source code to ensure nobody's ioquake3 clients or servers are ever compromised or hacked.

### Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately.
Please e-mail zachary@ioquake.org directly to provide details and repro steps and we will respond as soon as possible, but please note:

### This is an entirely free software project without much in the way of external funding or sponsorships.
### We cannot guarantee quick responses but we very much appreciate your discretion when reporting security vulnerabilities.
